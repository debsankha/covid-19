Some visualizations of official COVID-19 data
=============================================
This is a fork of https://github.com/felixpatzelt/covid-19. 
This is a hobby project to visualise the daily official numbers. 

We use:
* [Global data by Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
* [German data for individual reportings](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0/data)

There is an interactive web app based on plot.ly dash (app.py).

There are also exploratory Jupyter notebooks iwth more visualizations, and
an [animation on the world map](map_animation.mp4).

There are always undetected cases. Please keep in mind that data collection
methods may vary between countries and over time. Not being a domain expert, I
do not provide interpretation or anything beyond most simple transformations of
the data. 

*This is not a replacement for expert advice. Please listen to your local
health authorities.*
